# Payment Gateway Security Guide

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### 1. API Key Management
- **Never** expose secret keys in frontend code
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for development/production

### 2. Data Validation
- Validate all payment amounts on backend
- Verify order totals before processing
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting

### 3. Webhook Security
- Verify webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Implement idempotency for webhook handling
- Log all webhook events

### 4. PCI Compliance
- Never store credit card data
- Use payment gateway's secure forms
- Implement proper SSL/TLS
- Regular security audits

### 5. Error Handling
- Don't expose sensitive error details
- Log errors securely
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms
- Monitor failed transactions

## ðŸš€ Production Checklist

### Before Going Live:
- [ ] Switch to production API keys
- [ ] Enable webhook endpoints
- [ ] Test with real payment methods
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Configure backup payment methods
- [ ] Test refund functionality
- [ ] Verify tax calculations
- [ ] Test international payments
- [ ] Implement fraud detection

### Monitoring:
- Transaction success rates
- Failed payment reasons
- Webhook delivery status
- API response times
- Error rates and patterns

## ðŸ“Š Testing Strategy

### Test Cases:
1. Successful payments
2. Declined cards
3. Insufficient funds
4. Network timeouts
5. Webhook failures
6. Refund scenarios
7. Partial refunds
8. Currency conversions
9. International cards
10. 3D Secure authentication

### Test Cards (Stripe):
- Success: 4242424242424242
- Decline: 4000000000000002
- Insufficient funds: 4000000000009995
- 3D Secure: 4000000000003220

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS errors**: Configure proper headers
2. **Webhook timeouts**: Optimize processing time
3. **Double charges**: Implement idempotency
4. **Currency mismatches**: Validate currency codes
5. **Tax calculation errors**: Verify tax logic

### Debug Tools:
- Payment gateway dashboards
- Webhook testing tools
- Browser developer tools
- Server logs
- Database transaction logs
