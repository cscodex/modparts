-- Fix RLS Policies for Custom Authentication System
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor to fix the authentication issues

-- First, drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Categories are viewable by everyone" ON categories;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Categories are editable by admins" ON categories;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Products are viewable by everyone" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Products are editable by admins" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create own orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own order items" ON order_items;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own cart" ON cart_items;

-- Temporarily disable RLS to allow server-side operations
ALTER TABLE categories DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE products DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE orders DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE order_items DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE cart_items DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create new policies that allow server-side access
-- Since we're using server-side authentication with service role key,
-- we can allow all operations when using the service role

-- Categories: Allow all operations (products need to be readable by everyone)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on categories" ON categories FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Products: Allow all operations (products need to be readable by everyone)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on products" ON products FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Users: Allow all operations (we handle auth in application layer)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on users" ON users FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Orders: Allow all operations (we handle auth in application layer)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on orders" ON orders FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Order items: Allow all operations (we handle auth in application layer)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on order_items" ON order_items FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Cart items: Allow all operations (we handle auth in application layer)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on cart_items" ON cart_items FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Re-enable RLS with the new permissive policies
ALTER TABLE categories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE order_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
